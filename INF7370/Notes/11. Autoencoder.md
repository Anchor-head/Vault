# ðŸ¤” What is an [[11. Autoencoder slides.pdf|autoencoder]]?

An autoencoder is an unsupervised/self-supervised neural network that learns dense (latent) representations (A.K.A. encodings) of input. PCA++.

Often used in non-supervised pretraining for deep NNs.

# How do you train it?

![[11. Autoencoder slides.pdf#page=4]]

The autoencoder's task is to reproduce the input by passing it through a narrow central layer which acts as a bottleneck forcing only the most relevant features to be kept in that layer (which is the coding layer).

The architecture is most often symmetrical, even for deep autoencoders containing more than the 3 essential layers.

The outer layers are trained first.
