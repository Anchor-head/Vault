# Decision trees

## Growing decision trees
### Categorical variables

Let's take a dataset with categorical variables.

### Continuous variables

Make two categories out of the continuous variables, defined by a threshold; for example, body weight, a continuous variable, can be transformed into a binary variable with possible values "light" and "heavy" depending on how the weight is situated compared to a certain threshold value, and "light" in all other cases.

The threshold (in this example, 100k) is not chosen arbitrarily: it is chosen according to what maximizes entropy. Happy knowing!
