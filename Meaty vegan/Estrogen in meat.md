Steak on left, tofu on right split screen

Me in the middle talking:
"Can you guess which of these two foods has more estrogen?"

BRAINROT ALARM
STEAK AMOUNT OF ESTEOGEN IN RED
Soy has a green ZERO

In fact, the biggest sources of estrogen in food are:
- milk
- eggs
- red meat

But how are you surprised that:

- DRINKING LIQUID FROM A FEMALE COW'S BREASTS
- EATING THE FRUIT OF A CHICKEN'S OVARIES
- EATING WOMEN (cause most animals sold for meat are female)

would increase your estrogen?!

Should you be worried? Is it bad? Probably not? All I know is that if you're the kind of person who's worried about having estrogen in your food, then mind your own plate and spare us vegans the lesson cause we'll be fine.

Gee, I wonder why everyone knows about the "estrogen" in soy, but knows NOTHING about the ACTUAL estrogen in animal products! Who is hiding this from us?!

(during next paragraph, *flash ads about meat being manly, milk-drinking hero, etc.*)
It's almost as if public perception of vegan products is skewed by one of the biggest economic groups in the West: animal agriculture!

(insert DeSantis saying he wants to ban lab-grown meat to protect farmers)

Naaah!



BUT WHY is everyone talking about estrogen in SOY then?!

Soy contains PHYTO-estrogen, which is the less potent version of estrogen.

In fact, phyto-estrogen could even DECREASE your estrogen levels because it BLOCKS OUT estrogen
