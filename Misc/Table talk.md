# Energy vs hardship
Would you pick a career that's easy and makes a lot of money? Or a career that's hard but that you love?
Which one would you be better at?
Which one would you go farther in?
In which field are you more likely to become a legend?

We should not seek the path of least resistance, but the path that maximizes the formula "energy minus resistance".

# Energy
Let's talk about maximizing energy. Where does energy come from? I say, love is that energy. So enough love can more-than-compensate for any adversity; or, in Viktor Frankl's terms, "he who has a *why* can bear almost any *how*". And that *why*, for some people, is their kids, for whom they would do anything, and thanks to whom they are able to wake up every day and face any adversity that life throws at them. For others, that why is the love of their field, of their projects, of their career. But at the end of the day, no matter who you ask, the reason for everything people do always comes down to love; at the very least, love of oneself, of money, of status, of adventure, of a good game, of good art, of self-image, of family or community, of an ideology, or of a god. And of those who love nothing, could it be that they have nothing to live for?
# Love and decisions
And although love is our drive and even our lifeline, What do we love? Who decides what we love?

I love teaching. I love math. But why? Why do I love teaching and math? Will I ever stop loving these things? Can I choose to love something else?

It seems that our loves are not things we can argue with. They are deep, strong drives that appear to be assigned by something out of our control. So, lucky are we if these drives naturally align with a promising career path, a fashionable hobby, or something otherwise beneficial to us!

Those with such 

I like to think that most of us, through creativity and concessions, find a way to align our natural drives with our needs.
