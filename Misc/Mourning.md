# Why we can't "just move on"
## A rational perspective on why we need to dwell



# Preamble

A toxic idea has taken our culture by storm; that is, that the most rational reaction to any adversity is one of radical acceptance.

Under the charm of this "radical acceptance" movement, an adherent may try to act as if the adversities they face had never occurred --- because what does it matter *how* you got to point B if the way from point B to point C is the same? To a "perfectly rational", goal-oriented mind, the only difference between losing one of your teenage children in a housefire and never having had them in the first place is the pesky emotions. But if feelings were no object, rationalists reason, you would act identically in both situations.

The problem with this view is that it assumes that you wouldn't forget how to walk.

Now, the problem with this rationalistic way of thinking that says "let us move on, already!" is that it fails to consider the role that feelings play in decision-making; feelings are not the rational mind's opposing force, but its very pawns, and mourning is the process by which we recalibrate our feelings.

Let's take a step back.

### Feelings are pawns

If strategic thinking had a mascot, it would probably be a chess board; but this is perhaps the most misleading association we make in our culture.

Any advanced chess player with a grounded appreciation of their skill will tell you that chess is 95% a game not of thought, but of habit.

I take back what I said earlier; chess is actually the *perfect* symbol for strategic thinking, *precisely because* it demonstrates that high-quality reasoning relies on feeling.

Let's analyze , for excelling at playing the piano is not much different from excelling at making decisions.

moving along with life just as it was before the adversity occurred.

it and "act according to the possibilities of the future".

This idea is predicated on 

This idea fails to account for the fact that much of our decision-making processes are based on instincts that we cultivate through experience, and that, given that "pure thought" is an insufficient substitute for instinct, recalibrating instincts .
