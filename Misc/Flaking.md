I put off the assignment all week. It's Sunday, and it's due Monday at 9:30am.

I started off the day fine --- I worked for 5 hours in the afternoon to write a meagre paragraph, but the darker the sun set, the more I fell into gaming, my paragraph rotting in the background until a stomach-turning 1am decided that a pensive stroll might help me recollect and reclaim control. But by the time I got my coat and tied my boots, I already felt like I'd gotten what I needed. I kept tying 'em anyway.

A gust of sharp February wind whacked my cheeks --- not tonight, I felt; but since the house offered no warmer greetings, I descended the stairs into the alleyway anyway. A few steps later, I relaxed a certain haste in my gait, and tried finding that slow, reflective pace that marked my most intimate strolls. The night didn't fuck with it though.

I turned right on the street, but before long, I decided to return to the alleyway, just to see how it feels. I could feel the tension rising as I neared the alleyway again, anticipating how it would continue to rise as I neared the house, reached the door, entered, neared the dinner table where my laptop was open, sat down, touched the mousepad, clicked on the file, scrolled through meaningless white-on-black writing and equations... I couldn't do it. I was going to flake out at some point, give in and goon.


If you know you're gonna flake, why not flake right now?
Notice that the mere expectation of flaking is enough to flake consistently.
You're not gonna flake.

The people who do deal with stress well? It's those who know themselves. It's intelligence.
