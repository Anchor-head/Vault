Sweeter than any honeydew
Are the tears that fall from missing you
And how I wish I could make a pool
And drink it up, and pour anew

My nights are bright, my days are blind
Your light is 



In my day you shine a light
So bright that I canâ€™t sleep at night
Only in your presence, sleep can I find
For from so close, you leave me blind
