# Honeydew honeyboo
Sweeter than a honeydew
Are my tears from missing you
How I want to drink them too
And then to pour them out anew

Warmer than the Romanian sun
Is the hole left when you are gone
I cherish it like a prize won
I don't know what you have done

My days are hot, my eves are bright
Your light keeps me awake at night
Yet when you’re near, sleep I do find
But only ‘cause it leaves me blind

I wish that I can get to share
All my love while I’m still there

My honeyboo, I love missing you
