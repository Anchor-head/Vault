# Honeydew honeyboo

Sweeter than a honeydew
Are my tears from missing you
What kind of love, my honeyboo,
Leaves one happy when away too?

Warmer than the Romanian sun
Is the hole left when you are gone
I cherish it like a prize won
You don't know what you have done

My days are hot, my eves are bright
Airways bar shut, my breather's tight
Your lip meets me and quakes my height
Your light keeps me awake at night

Yet when youâ€™re near, sleep I do find
Only because you scorch me blind
Because you have, if you don't mind
Great assets I can get behind

I wish that I can get to share
All my love while you're still here
I hope you stay, but if you don't
I'll live on enjoying this warm hole

Yet even beyond that, I fear,
I could not help sending you prayers
