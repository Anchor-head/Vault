# Honeydew
Sweeter than a honeydew
Are my tears from missing you
How I want to drink them too
And gulp, and pour them out anew

Warmer than the Romanian sun
Is the hole left when you are gone
I cherish it like a prize won
Tell me, when can we be one?

My days are hot, my eves are bright
Your light keeps me awake at night
Yet when you’re near, sleep I do find
But only ‘cause it leaves me blind

In my day you shine a light
So bright that I can’t sleep at night
Only in your presence, sleep can I find
For from so close, you leave me blind
